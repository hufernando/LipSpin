# LipSpin

LipSpin allows the quantitative profiling of 1H-NMR spectra of lipid samples in batch mode. The program provides a GUI environment to navigate across the spectral line and a set of user-friendly tools to configure the signal patterns included in the quantification process. The quantification of the individual signals is carried out by using a constrained lineshape fitting routine or by simple bucket integration. LipSpin also includes a set of pre-processing functions typically applied to NMR spectra before quantitative analysis.
