# LipSpin

LipSpin allows the quantitative profiling 1H-NMR spectra of lipid samples in batch mode. The tool provides a GUI environment to navigate across the spectral line and a set of user-friendly tools to configure the signal patterns included in the quantification process. The quantification of the individual signals is carried out using a constrained lineshape fitting routine and simple bucket integration. LipSpin also includes a set of pre-processing functions typically applied to NMR spectra before quantitative analysis.
