# LipSpin

LipSpin allows profiling 1H-NMR spectra of lipid samples in batch mode. The tool provides a user-friendly GUI environment to customise signal patterns to include in the quantification process, which is carried out using a constrained lineshape fitting routine. LipSpin also include the set of pre-processing functions typically applied to NMR spectra before quantitative analysis.

Consult the User manual for information about LipSpin use and features.
